This repository contains the implementation of Exercise 3.1 from the DevOps with Docker course, offered by the University of Helsinki.

The goal of this exercise is to set up a deployment pipeline for a simple Node.js/Express application using GitHub Actions and Docker. The pipeline ensures that a new Docker image is automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
